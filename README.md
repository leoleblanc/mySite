Created initial code in this repository with Next.js using `npx create-next-app@latest`. 

# mySite
My personal website. This will be used to showcase my abilities to deploy a site while configuring the appropriate infrastructure, and as a reference for myself and others on how to go about the process. While there are countless videos out there... I just wanted to try it out for myself. 

Conducting more research about where to host and whether or not I should use VPS with a next.js site.

current dependencies:
* NPM (Node Package Manager)
* Next.js
