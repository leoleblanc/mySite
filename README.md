# My Personal Website
My personal website! This is currently a work in progress. Eventually, this will be hosted on https://leoleblanc.net... because .com was taken :(

Note: The commit history on this repository appears to have multiple contributors before and up to May 11th. Those were also me, but I am using an older computer and didn't do the `git config` jazz. Since then, it has been done, and all commits should be accurate going forward. If they aren't, then... :|
